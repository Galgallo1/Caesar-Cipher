# CAESER CYPHER 
Caeser Cypher is a java application that encrypts or decrypts text using the Caeser Cypher technique. Users input a text they want encrypted or decrypted, and the shift key, and each letter is shifted forward by the number of letters the key value is during encryption, and backward during decryption.
